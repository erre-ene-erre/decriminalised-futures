Textcontent: <p><em>LONS was a two part course that ran for three months between October to December 2021, and again between April to June 2022. Each month we collectively explored a new topic. The focus was less on current legislations and campaigns, and more at how we got where we are today.</em></p><h2>Anti Trafficking in the Caribbean (May 2022)</h2><p>For many decades in the Caribbean, particular migrant women have been constructed as exotic, erotic subjects, yet are deemed to be either victims of human trafficking networks or “loose” women. This talk took a closer look at these trends as reflected in public discourses, policies and laws through a consideration of the treatment of migrant women in the region, especially from Venezuela and the Dominican Republic, and of the challenges they pose to anti-trafficking discourses.</p><p><em>Lecture</em> by Kamala Kempadoo (Tuesday May 3rd, 7pm – 8.30pm)</p><p><em>Seminar</em> by Emily Kenway (Monday May 9th 6.30pm – 8.30pm)</p><p><strong><em>Kamala Kempadoo</em></strong> is Professor in the Department of Social Science at York University, Canada, with appointments in Gender, Feminist and Women’s Studies, Political Science, Social and Political Thought, and Development Studies.
