Textcontent: <p><em>In May 2019, SWARM hosted a three day festival to celebrate ten years of organising. This included panel discussions across a wide range of topics that impact on sex workers, and which connect and intersect with sex worker rights organising as well as broader struggles for justice. The conversations and discussions from that festival lay the groundwork for the Decriminalised Futures project.</em></p><h2>Strength, Resilience, and Healthcare (May 2019)</h2><p>With so many people alienated from traditional systems of care, what do liberated forms of healthcare look like? How is resilience developed in the face of marginalisation and criminalisation? Where do communities draw strength from when it comes to emphasising not only care but survival? Exploring radical visions of health, these panellists come from a range of backgrounds in trans health, public health, mental health, and HIV activism.</p><p><strong>Speakers: Micha Frazer-Carroll, Effie (SWARM), Bakita Kasadha (Global Network of Young People Living with HIV), Pippa Grenfell (LSTHM), Ember (Action for Trans Health), Dana (Action for Trans Health)</strong></p>
