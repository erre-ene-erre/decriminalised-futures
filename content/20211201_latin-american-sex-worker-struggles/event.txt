Textcontent: <p><em>Lady of the Night School was a two part course that ran for three months between October to December 2021, and again between April to June 2022. Each month we collectively explored a new topic. The focus was less on current legislations and campaigns, and more at how we got where we are today.</em></p><h2>Latin American Sex Worker Struggles (December 2021)</h2><p>This session explored different sex worker organising movements across Latin America with a focus on Argentina. We looked at significant moments and movement leaders, how these local movements came about, the context that produced these types of organising and movements, and how this links to what the political landscape looks like today.</p><p><em>Lecture</em> by Eugenia Aravena (AMMAR) (Monday 29th November, 7.00 – 8.30pm)</p><p><em>Seminar</em> by Kate Hardy (Monday 13th December, 6.30 – 8.30pm)</p><p><strong><em>Eugenia Aravena</em></strong> is a member of the organisations Plaperts (The Latín American Network of Sex Working People) and the RRTS (Network for the Recognition of Sex Work)</p><p><em><sub>This course is made possible with generous support from the Barry Amiel &amp; Norman Melburn Trust and the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation.</sub></em></p>
