Textcontent: <p><em>Lady of the Night School was a two part course that ran for three months between October to December 2021, and again between April to June 2022. Each month we collectively explored a new topic. The focus was less on current legislations and campaigns, and more at how we got where we are today.</em></p><h2>Trans Sex Workers Through History (November 2021)</h2><p>Though the present day trans movement pays lip service to the contributions of trans sex workers through the canonization of Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson, the histories of trans people and sex workers are far more deeply entwined than they seem! In this lecture, historian and activist Morgan M Page took us on a whistle stop tour of trans sex workers across more than 700 years of history, from the first appearance of what we might today call a trans sex worker in the English language, to present day activists fighting for liberation and decriminalisation.</p><p><em>Lecture</em> by Morgan M.
