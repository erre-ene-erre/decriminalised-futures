Textcontent: <p><em>Lady of the Night School was a two part course that ran for three months between October to December 2021, and again between April to June 2022. Each month we collectively explored a new topic. The focus was less on current legislations and campaigns, and more at how we got where we are today.</em></p><h2>Sex Workers Built the Internet (April 2022)</h2><p>It’s time to have “The Talk” with technologists. From Call Girls to Cam Girls, sex workers have been some of the greatest innovators on the possibilities of harnessing technology. But we currently live in a present in which technology is explicitly built to target and eliminate sex work. In other words, to Big Tech the sex worker is as indispensable as they are disposable. This lecture outlined this tradition of innovation-to-elimination, and explored how we might code sex worker ethics into future design.</p><p><em>Lecture</em> by Gabriella Garcia, hosted by Nim Ralph (Monday April 4th, 7pm – 8.30pm)</p><p><em>Seminar</em> by Debs Durojaiye (Monday 11th April, 6.30 – 8.30pm)</p><p><strong><em>Gabriella Garcia (she/her)</em></strong> is the co-founder of Decoding Stigma, a cross-institutional working group that calls for the inclusion of sex worker voices in all spaces that purport to be designing the future.
