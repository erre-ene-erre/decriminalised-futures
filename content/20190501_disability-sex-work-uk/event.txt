Textcontent: <p><em>In May 2019, SWARM hosted a three day festival to celebrate ten years of organising. This included panel discussions across a wide range of topics that impact on sex workers, and which connect and intersect with sex worker rights organising as well as broader struggles for justice. The conversations and discussions from that festival lay the groundwork for the Decriminalised Futures project.</em></p><h2>How Do Disability and Sex Work Intersect in the UK Today (May 2019)</h2><p>Do disabled people require access to sex work or to sex workers? Many sex workers are disabled – what about their clients? Is sex work an easy way out of the benefits system? This panel will look at how disability and sex work intertwine in the UK, and which changes would allow justice for disabled people and for sex workers.</p><p><strong>Speakers: Trixie Roberts, Rosa Thomas (Decrim Now), Lydia Caradonna (Decrim Now), Emily Rose Yates (Enhance)</strong></p><p><strong>Themes: disability, sex work, violence against women, racism, health</strong></p>
