Textcontent: <p><em>In May 2019, SWARM hosted a three day festival to celebrate ten years of organising. This included panel discussions across a wide range of topics that impact on sex workers, and which connect and intersect with sex worker rights organising as well as broader struggles for justice. The conversations and discussions from that festival lay the groundwork for the Decriminalised Futures project.</em></p><h2>The Future of Work (May 2019)</h2><p>How do we understand work? Our beliefs around what constitutes work and what kinds of work are valued are ever changing: whether it be the ways care and sexual labour are regarded, the role of exploitation and criminalisation, or imagining what a post-work terrain could look like. Broader social and labour struggles, as well as unionising movements, have brought us here, but where do we go next?</p><p><strong>Speakers: Katie Cruz, Selma James, Layla-Roxanne Hill, Chloe (SWARM), Molly Smith, Will Stronge (Autonomy)</strong></p>
