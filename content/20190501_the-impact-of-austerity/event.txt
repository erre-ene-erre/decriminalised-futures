Textcontent: <p><em>In May 2019, SWARM hosted a three day festival to celebrate ten years of organising. This included panel discussions across a wide range of topics that impact on sex workers, and which connect and intersect with sex worker rights organising as well as broader struggles for justice. The conversations and discussions from that festival lay the groundwork for the Decriminalised Futures project.</em></p><h2>The Impact of Austerity (May 2019)</h2><p>In a landscape of increasing austerity and rising poverty, this panel will delve into how austerity harms sex workers, women of colour and families across the UK. It will ask the question: are austerity policies themselves acts of violence?</p><p><strong>Speakers: Mercredi Addams (SWARM), Sara Callaway (Global Women’s Strike), Cari Mitchell (English Collective of Prostitutes), Kimberly McIntosh (Runnymede Trust), Dr Vickie Cooper</strong></p><p></p>
