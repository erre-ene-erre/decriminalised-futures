Textcontent: <p><em>In May 2019, SWARM hosted a three day festival to celebrate ten years of organising. This included panel discussions across a wide range of topics that impact on sex workers, and which connect and intersect with sex worker rights organising as well as broader struggles for justice. The conversations and discussions from that festival lay the groundwork for the Decriminalised Futures project.</em></p><h2>Sex Workers on the Nordic Model (May 2019)</h2><p><br>Under the Nordic Model – sometimes called the “sex buyers law” – sex workers’ clients are criminalised. On this panel, sex workers living in countries affected by this legal model gather to share their views and talk about their experiences. If you’ve seen calls for the introduction of the Nordic Model, or heard debate about how successful it’s been in the countries where it has been implemented, this panel is an opportunity for insight into the lived experiences of those most impacted by this legal change.</p><p><strong>Speakers: Luca Stevenson (ICRSE), Ophelia (Fuckförbundet), Mimi Aum Neko (STRASS), Kate McGrew (SWAI), Hanna (PION)</strong></p>
