Textcontent: <p><em>In May 2019, SWARM hosted a three day festival to celebrate ten years of organising. This included panel discussions across a wide range of topics that impact on sex workers, and which connect and intersect with sex worker rights organising as well as broader struggles for justice. The conversations and discussions from that festival lay the groundwork for the Decriminalised Futures project.</em></p><h2>Radical Histories: Exploring the Archives (May 2019)</h2><p>Who writes history? Our panellists discussed the vital work of collecting radical histories, what this entails and how it can change our perception of both the past and present. Our panellists have archived histories of Black, LGBTQ and sex worker communities, centring those who are often side-lined by dominant narratives.</p><p>You’ll hear stories from the archives, learn how these hidden histories are gathered and leave with a renewed understanding of why we must challenge imperialist, heteronormative versions of our past.</p><p><strong>Speakers: Dr Kate Lister, Mumbi Nkonde, Morgan M Page, Jay Bernard, Itziar Bilbao Urrutia</strong></p>
