Info: <p><strong>Decriminalised Futures</strong> is a collaborative project using creative tools and popular education to explore sex worker lives, experiences and movement struggles.</p><p><code>&lt;div class='pdf-button'&gt;</code><a href="http://localhost:8080/panel/pages/about/files/application-for-insurance-rodrigo-nava-ramirez.pdf">Manifesto</a><code>&lt;/div&gt;</code></p><p>In 2019, organisers from the Sex Workers Advocacy and Resistance Movement (<a href="https://www.swarmcollective.org/" target="_blank">SWARM</a>) curated a three day festival to celebrate the group’s ten year anniversary. The event was an opportunity to reflect on SWARM’s history and achievements, building on the community-based organising work done over the past decade. It was also an occasion to continue discovering and exploring the connections between the sex worker rights movement and other struggles. Throughout the weekend more than 400 people gathered to create a radical and uplifting feminist space. Over 90 different speakers, artists, activists, academics, researchers, sex workers, poets &amp; organisers shared ideas, discussion and knowledge. We built collaboration and loving solidarity, educated each other, and had fun.<br><br>That festival lay the groundwork for this project, where our work continues today.</p><p>In the years since, we have supported the creation of new artwork, held exhibitions, panel discussions and workshops, facilitated reading groups, and produced resources that highlight a range of sex worker experiences. We embrace the messy complexity of sex workers’ lives and histories, while also contextualising these experiences in broader political and social moments. We produce accessible political and creative work, events and education by bringing together artists and organisers from a wide range of backgrounds. Our goal is to celebrate creative expression of all kinds as a tool for deeper solidarity between global social justice struggles. </p><p></p><p><em>Decriminalised Futures is designed by sex workers, and made for sex workers.</em> </p>
