Textcontent: <p><em>In May 2019, SWARM hosted a three day festival to celebrate ten years of organising. This included panel discussions across a wide range of topics that impact on sex workers, and which connect and intersect with sex worker rights organising as well as broader struggles for justice. The conversations and discussions from that festival lay the groundwork for the Decriminalised Futures project.</em></p><h2>(Resisting) Systems of Violence (May 2019)</h2><p>We know from our lives and from looking out at the world that there are many ways in which different forms of violence, oppression and marginalisation intersect. This panel brings together activists, academics, artists and writers to explore the importance of these intersections and to strategise the ways we can act in solidarity and collaboration in responding to and disrupting systems of violence.</p>
