Textcontent: <p><em>In May 2019, SWARM hosted a three day festival to celebrate ten years of organising. This included panel discussions across a wide range of topics that impact on sex workers, and which connect and intersect with sex worker rights organising as well as broader struggles for justice. The conversations and discussions from that festival lay the groundwork for the Decriminalised Futures project.</em></p><h2>IMAGINING FEMINIST FUTURES (MAY 2019)</h2><p>Feminism is a key political and organising principle for many movements grounded in liberation and justice, including the one for sex worker rights. For this panel we come together to reflect on the role of feminism in movement struggles and to share our visions for a feminist future.</p><p><strong>Speakers: Lola Olufemi, Juno Mac, Hello Rooster, Lydia Caradonna, Jade Bentil, Mimi Aum Neko, Chryssy Hunter, Aviah Sarah Day</strong></p><p></p><p></p>
