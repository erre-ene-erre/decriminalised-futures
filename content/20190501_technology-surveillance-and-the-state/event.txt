Textcontent: <p><em>In May 2019, SWARM hosted a three day festival to celebrate ten years of organising. This included panel discussions across a wide range of topics that impact on sex workers, and which connect and intersect with sex worker rights organising as well as broader struggles for justice. The conversations and discussions from that festival lay the groundwork for the Decriminalised Futures project.</em></p><h2>Technology, Surveillance and the State: How We Resist (May 2019)</h2><p>Online crackdowns against sex workers are on the rise. The UK’s imminent porn ban will push independent porn producers out of business; porn bans on sites like Tumblr have devastated online communities; in the US, last year’s introduction of the FOSTA/SESTA bills led to the closure of sites like Backpage, on which thousands of sex workers relied for their living. This panel will gather together the voices of sex workers from across the industry, as well as campaigners with an interest in broader issues around the online censorship and surveillance of marginalised communities discussing what’s happening and how we can resist the carceral, censorious agenda being played out.</p><p><strong>Speakers: Helen Hester, Juno Mac, Gracie Mae Bradley, Camille Melissa, Amina du Jean</strong></p>
