Textcontent: <p><em>In May 2019, SWARM hosted a three day festival to celebrate ten years of organising. This included panel discussions across a wide range of topics that impact on sex workers, and which connect and intersect with sex worker rights organising as well as broader struggles for justice. The conversations and discussions from that festival lay the groundwork for the Decriminalised Futures project.</em></p><h2>Radical Transfeminist Activism (May 2019)</h2><p>What does radical transfeminism look like currently? How does it relate to or overlap with sex worker organising? How can the sex worker movement and radical transfeminists organise together?</p><p><strong>Speakers: Chryssy Hunter, Morgan Page, Mijke van der Drift</strong></p><p></p><p></p>
