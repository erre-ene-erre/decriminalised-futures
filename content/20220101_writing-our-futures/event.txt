Textcontent: <p>Writing Our Futures was an opportunity to get creative and politically active, build community and solidarity with other sex workers and become self-advocates for sex worker rights.</p><p>Over 5 weeks in 2021 and 2022, sex workers learned about representations of sex workers in TV and film, discussed the history and future of political sex worker movements, explored different storytelling techniques, and created their own piece of work on a story they want to tell. Through guided creative workshops, participants had the chance to work on an idea from start to finish. Thinking about narrative, characters, plot devices, they developed a piece to showcase by the end of the series.</p><p>You can view the zines from 2021 here: <a href="https://decriminalisedfutures.erre-ene-erre.org/panel/pages/writing-our-futures/files/writing_zine_2.pdf">writing_zine_2.pdf</a></p><p>And 2022 here:  <a href="https://decriminalisedfutures.erre-ene-erre.org/panel/pages/writing-our-futures/files/final-version-wof_v2_feb2022_spreads-1.pdf">final-version-wof_v2_feb2022_spreads-1.pdf</a></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
