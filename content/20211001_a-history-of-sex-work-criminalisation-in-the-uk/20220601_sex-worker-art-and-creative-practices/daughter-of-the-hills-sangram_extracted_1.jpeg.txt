Info: <p>'Daughter of the Hills' looks at trafficking and migration. It's a resource shared by SANGRAM. SANGRAM was established in 1992 in Sangli, Maharashtra, has grown into a series of collective empowerment groups for stigmatized communities (sex workers, MSM, and transgender individuals) in six districts of southern Maharashtra and northern Karnataka. SANGRAM is unique in being a women-led, rights-based group that seeks to change community norms and tackle gender inequities at the grassroots level. These inequities include gender-based violence (GBV), access to resources, and rights in terms of protection, property, and power. SANGRAM also works at a deeper level by addressing male norms. </p><p>You can find SANGRAM's website <a href="https://www.sangram.org/">here</a>. </p><p>To view the full illustrated ebook 'Daughter of the Hills', click <a href="https://www.sangram.org/resources/daughter-of-the-hills-sangram.pdf">here</a>. </p>
