It is the name of a clothing brand created to raise funds for the sex worker NGO Davida. The name Daspu is also a parody on Daslu (“Dasloo”), a famous luxury department store created by and for socialites from São Paulo, the richest city in Latin America.</p><p>Text via <em>Red Umbrella Fund</em>, <a href="https://www.redumbrellafund.org/artivism/">'Artivism: A guerrilla tool for sex worker movements'</a> by Aline Fantinatti</p>
