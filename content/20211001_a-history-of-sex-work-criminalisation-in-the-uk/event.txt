Textcontent: <p><em>Lady of the Night School was a two part course that ran for three months between October to December 2021, and again between April to June 2022. Each month we collectively explored a new topic. The focus was less on current legislations and campaigns, and more at how we got where we are today.</em></p><h2>A History of Sex Work Criminalisation (October 2021)</h2><p>This session examined the ways commercial sex was criminalised in Britain and the effects this had in the 19th and 20th centuries. We looked at relevant histories of trafficking and migration, and at early 20th century ‘decriminalisation’ campaigns.</p><p></p><p>Weird unexplicable truths.</p><p><em>Lecture</em> by Dr Julia Laite (Thursday 7th October, 7.00 – 8.30pm, online)</p><p><em>Seminar</em> by Alex Wanjiku Kelbert (Monday 18th October, 6.30 – 8.30pm, online)</p><p><strong><em><sub>Julia Laite</sub></em></strong><sub> is a Reader in Modern History and Director of the Raphael Samuel History Centre at at Birkbeck, University of London.
