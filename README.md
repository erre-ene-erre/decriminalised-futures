Decriminalised Futures is a UK based collaborative project using creative tools and popular education to explore sex workers lives, experiences and movement struggles.

The design and function of this website is inspired by sci-fi police force aesthetics and judicial records archiving practices. It shapes and works as a systemic occupation as means to challenge these oppressive structures.
